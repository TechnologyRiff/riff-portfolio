      <p>My path to teaching has been unique.  I am inspired to teach by my own negative experiences of education as a child.  When I read Savage Inequalities by Jonathan Kozal in high school, I came to the conclusion that despite the vast differences between my school and the schools he was describing, the fundamental problems with the education system were the same—students are not respected and responded to as valuable individuals and the innate curiosity and love of learning all children are born with is structurally devalued and destroyed.  

I became a teacher in order to value students as individuals and encourage students’ natural desire to learn. Each of us is born with an innate desire to learn. As children we are constantly exploring and making discoveries in the world around us. 
 In order to maintain students’ internal motivation, I believe students need to be supported in asking questions and my most important role as the teacher is to coach students in pursuing answers to their own questions.</p>
